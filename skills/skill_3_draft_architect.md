# Skill 3: Draft Architect

## Overview
Takes the 6-week roadmap and Strategic Intent Document to produce the first version of each post. Focuses on getting the structure, key points, and narrative right before voice refinement.

## Inputs
- **Strategic Intent Document**: Output from Skill 1.
- **6-Week Content Roadmap**: Output from Skill 2.

## Outputs
- **6 Initial Drafts**: One per week, each 150-300 words with full post structure.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Each Draft
For each of the 6 weeks, produce a draft with this structure:

```
**Hook**: [1-2 sentences — must be compelling enough to survive LinkedIn's "See more" truncation]

[Body: 2-3 short paragraphs or bullet points explaining the core idea for this week]

**Insight**: [One memorable takeaway sentence]

**CTA**: [Clear action the reader can take this week]

[3-5 hashtags]

**Coming Next Week**: [1-sentence teaser linking to next week's theme]
```

### Step 2: Incorporate the Personal Anecdote
- Weave the user's personal anecdote (from Q3) into Week 3's draft.
- Frame it as a genuine first-person experience, not a hypothetical.
- If no anecdote was provided, flag this as "[PLACEHOLDER — personal story needed]".

### Step 3: Apply Anti-AI-ism Rules
Avoid these patterns in ALL drafts:
- "In today's fast-paced world..." / "In the era of..."
- "Let's dive in..." / "Let's explore..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "In conclusion..." / "To sum up..."
- Excessive hedging ("might," "could potentially," "it's worth considering")
- Lists that start with "Here are X things..."

Instead, use:
- Direct, declarative statements
- Specific numbers and examples
- Short sentences for emphasis
- Questions as hooks

## Constraints
- Each draft must be 150-300 words (LinkedIn optimal length for thought leadership).
- Each draft must stand alone as a valuable post, even if read without the series context.
- The tone should match what was specified in the Strategic Intent Document.

## Failure Modes
- **Drafts too generic**: If a draft reads like it could be about any topic, it needs more specificity. Add concrete examples, numbers, or tool names.
- **Drafts too long**: LinkedIn truncates after ~210 characters. Ensure the hook is compelling within the first 2 lines.

## Example
```
Week 1: The "Good Enough" Trap

Hook: Is your data platform actually "good enough," or is it just holding you back?

Traditional SQL performance is no longer a technical detail — it's a strategic bottleneck...
```
